  { "rating": 4.7, "text": "We were greeted by the owner. He was very friendly. The food was great. I would recommend the salmon skin salad. It’s truly one of a kind. They have many options of rolls. He specially made a roll called “Hokkaido” - which was pretty good. It’s not on the menu, but worth a shot asking him if there’s anything he recommends that’s not on the menu! The spider roll was great too - FYI - this roll is pretty big in size. They have quite a few high chair and the venue is wheelchair accessible." },

The rice and all ingredients were super fresh and slightly warm. Awesome! Best sushi I've had in Calgary!" },
  { "rating": 4.6, "text": "Overall, everything was above average but not memorable. Sushi pieces, especially sashimi, were fairly well/generously portioned and quality is good. Presentation was nice. Quality and quantity to price ratio is very fair. Good neighborhood spot, but I wouldn’t say it’s a destination. Service was pleasant. Ambience is clean and very functional." },
  { "rating": 5.0, "text": "Li-Ao Sushi in Nolan Hill is arguably among the best in its price class! Generous portions of sashimi, surprisingly nice presentation of things like the tuna tataki and excellent, friendly service means we will definitely be back!" },
